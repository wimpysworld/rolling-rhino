## Introduction

Rolling Rhino is a simple tool to convert Ubuntu Desktop, and the official
desktop flavours, that has been installed from a daily image into a
*"rolling release"* by opting into and tracking the `devel` series.

Rolling Rhino is intended for Ubuntu developers and experienced Ubuntu users
who want to install Ubuntu once and the track all development updates with
automatic tracking of subsequent series.

## Caveats

If you use Rolling Rhino to opt-in to `devel` series you're assuming support
of your system, including taking care of PPA migrations, cleaning
obsolete/orphaned packages and **actively participating in any issue resolution
for problems you may encounter** via [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net) using
tools such as `apport` and `ubuntu-bug`.

### Origins of Rolling Rhino

[Ubuntu Podcast](https://ubuntupodcast.org) had feedback about making Ubuntu
a rolling release, something we discussed during the main segment of
[S13E12 - Red Sky in the Morning](https://ubuntupodcast.org/2020/06/11/s13e12-red-sky-in-the-morning/)
and then covered again based on listener feedback during
[S13E14 - Ace of Spades](https://ubuntupodcast.org/2020/06/25/s13e14-ace-of-spades/).
During episode S13E14 guest presenter [Stuart Langridge](https://twitter.com/sil)
proposed *"Ubuntu Rolling Rhino"* as the name for a rolling Ubuntu release
along with some ideas as to how it could be implemented. [Sergio Schvezov](https://twitter.com/sergiusens) then
[followed up via Twitter reminding us that the `devel` series exists in Ubuntu](https://twitter.com/sergiusens/status/1276479711372292096).
This inspired me to create this `rolling-rhino` tool to somewhat implement
Stuart's idea by taking advantage of the `devel` series.

### Where it all came together

See the video where I worked with the community to put together the initial implementation of `rolling-rhino`.

## Usage

  * Install Ubuntu Desktop, or one of the desktop flavours, **from a daily image**.
    * [Ubuntu Desktop Daily Build](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/daily-live/current/)
    * [Kubuntu Daily Build](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/daily-live/current/)
    * [Lubuntu Daily Build](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/lubuntu/daily-live/current/)
    * [Ubuntu Budgie Daily Build](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-budgie/daily-live/current/)
    * [Ubuntu Kylin Daily Build](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntukylin/daily-live/current/)
    * [Ubuntu MATE Daily Build](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntu-mate/daily-live/current/)
    * [Ubuntu Studio Daily Build](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/ubuntustudio/dvd/current/)
    * [Xubuntu Daily Build](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/xubuntu/daily-live/current/)
  * Boot the new install and use `rolling-rhino` to convert it to a rolling release.

```
git clone https://github.com/wimpysworld/rolling-rhino.git
cd rolling-rhino
./rolling-rhino
```

Which will output something like this:

```
Rolling Rhino ü¶è
  [+] INFO: lsb_release detected.
  [+] INFO: Ubuntu detected.
  [+] INFO: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS detected.
  [+] INFO: Detected ubuntu-desktop.
  [+] INFO: No PPAs detected, this is good.
  [+] INFO: All checks passed.
Are you sure want to start tracking the devel series? [Y/N]
```

## TODO

  - [x] Detect system is running an Ubuntu Development Branch.
  - [x] Detect desktop meta packages.
  - [x] Detect PPAs.
  - [x] Detect `sources.list` is not already tracking `devel`.
  - [x] Create clean `sources.list` that tracks `devel`.
  - [ ] Use `yad` to [create a UI](https://sanana.kiev.ua/index.php/yad)
